CRUD service for Vehicles

This is a solution implemented using the Grails framework to provide CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) for a Vehicle entity. 

## What is Grails?
Grails is a MVC framework that runs on the Groovy language (which is based on Java).

## Prerequisites
Grails should be installed in order to run this application.

The easy way to install Grails is to use the Software Development Kit Manager (SDKMAN!) on bash platforms. Run the following commands in succession:

<code>$ curl -s get.sdkman.io | bash
$ source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
$ sdk install grails
</code>

Run <code> $ grails -version </code> to verify installation.


Alternatively, Grails can be downloaded as a binary distribution: see https://grails.org/download.html.

## Running the application
Make sure Grails is installed.

Navigate to the home folder of the project. From the command prompt or terminal, type <code>grails run-app</code>. The application can then be accessed from the brower at http://localhost:8080/.
