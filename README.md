This is a solution to provide CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) for a Vehicle entity. It is implemented using the Grails framework.

## What is Grails?
Grails is a MVC framework that runs on the Groovy language (which is based on Java).

## Prerequisites
Grails should be installed in order to run this application. There are two ways to install Grails:

1. The easy way to install Grails is to use the Software Development Kit Manager (SDKMAN!) on bash platforms. Run the following commands in succession:

  <code>$ curl -s get.sdkman.io | bash</code>

  <code>$ source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"</code>

  <code>$ sdk install grails</code>

  Run <code>$ grails -version </code> to verify installation.

2. Alternatively, Grails can be downloaded as a binary distribution: see https://grails.org/download.html.

## Running the application
1. Make sure Grails is installed!
2. Navigate to the home folder of the project: <code>.../mitchell/mitchell/</code>
3. Type the command <code>grails prod run-app</code>
4. The application can be accessed from any web browser at <code>http://localhost:8080/</code>
